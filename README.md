## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

I'm currently studying Economics at the University of Macedonia in Thessaloniki, Greece.  
But my real passion? Building games and software!  
Whether I'm experimenting with new ideas or refining tools for other developers, I love turning creativity and code into something people can use and enjoy.
