# Hi, I'm Christos Maragkos 

I'm currently studying Economics at the University of Macedonia in Thessaloniki, Greece.  
But my real passion? Building games and software!  
Whether I'm experimenting with new ideas or refining tools for other developers, I love turning creativity and code into something people can use and enjoy.
## My Skills
- I mostly code in C# and Java. However, I also have some experience in Python and JavaScript, and am currently developing my frontend skills.
- The tools I use: VSCode, JetBrains Rider and IntelliJ IDEA, Notepad++, as well as any and all tools I create to fill holes in my workflow!
